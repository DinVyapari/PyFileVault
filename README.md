# PyFileVault

A secure, cryptographic utility for encrypting your confidential data.
### **Make sure that you do not forgot the secret key used for encrypting files. There is no way to recover a file if the secret key is forgotten.**

Program can be run directly using the `exe` file or alternatively via the `py` file (`crypography` module needed). Or you can compile the code on your own system using `compile.bat`.<br><br>
Preview files feature is a WIP. Only Windows is supported as of now.<br><br>
Feel free to fix bugs/add more features and send pull requests. :D
