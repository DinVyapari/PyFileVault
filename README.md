# PyFileVault

### A secure, cryptographic utility for encrypting your confidential data.
Encryption is completely offline and zero-knowledge. Encrypted files are portable.<br>
Original files will be deleted on encryption, be careful!

### **Make sure that you do not forgot the secret key used for encrypting files. There is no way to recover a file if the secret key is forgotten.**

Program can be run directly using the `exe` file or alternatively via the `py` file (`crypography` module needed). Or you can compile the code on your own system using `compile.bat`.

## To Do
